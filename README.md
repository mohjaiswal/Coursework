# ECN627: Introduction to Econometrics - Portfolio

## Moh Jaiswal's Coursework and Projects at Ryerson University

Welcome to my personal portfolio for ECN627: Introduction to Econometrics, a pivotal course in my Economics and Management Science degree at Ryerson University. This course laid the foundation for my understanding of econometric principles and honed my skills in applying these techniques to real-world economic data analysis.

### Course Overview

ECN627 is designed around the practical application of econometric techniques, focusing on the linear regression model, estimation, inference, and addressing complexities such as heteroscedasticity, endogeneity, and the analysis of binary dependent variables. This course has been instrumental in equipping me with the analytical tools necessary for conducting robust econometric research, critical for my aspiring career in data analysis and financial modeling.

### Key Topics and Personal Insights:

- **Linear Regression Model:** Gained a deep understanding of applying linear regression in economic analyses, crucial for my future projects and research in econometrics.
- **Estimation and Inference:** Mastered techniques for estimating econometric models and making sound inferences, which I applied in my internship projects.
- **Heteroscedasticity:** Learned to identify and correct heteroscedasticity in regression models, enhancing the reliability of my analyses.
- **Endogeneity:** Tackled endogeneity issues, ensuring the validity of econometric models in my academic and professional work.
- **Binary Dependent Variables:** Explored regression techniques for models with binary dependent variables, broadening my analytical capabilities.

## Personal Achievements and Projects

Throughout this course, I engaged in several projects that not only demonstrated my ability to apply econometric concepts but also allowed me to explore the practical implications of these techniques in economic and financial analysis.

### Major Projects:

- **Econometric Analysis of Housing Prices:** Utilized linear regression models to analyze factors influencing housing prices in Toronto. This project helped me understand the dynamics of real estate markets and the impact of various economic indicators.
- **Stock Market Returns Analysis:** Conducted an econometric study on the determinants of stock market returns using time-series data, applying knowledge of heteroscedasticity and endogeneity to refine the analysis.

### Skills Developed:

- Proficiency in statistical software for econometric analysis.
- Ability to critically evaluate and conduct econometric research.
- Enhanced problem-solving skills through the application of econometric techniques to economic data.
- Improved communication skills by presenting complex econometric findings in an understandable manner.

## Course Materials and Tools

- **Textbook:** Applied Econometrics with R. This resource was invaluable for understanding the application of econometric models in R.
- **Software:** Gained proficiency in R and STATA for conducting econometric analysis, crucial tools in my ongoing academic and professional development.

## Assessment and Recognition

My performance in ECN627 was marked by high grades in both coursework and exams, reflecting my commitment to mastering econometric analysis. The final research project was a standout achievement, receiving commendation from my professors for its insightful analysis and application of econometric techniques.
