# ECN627 & ECN702: Econometrics I & II - Portfolio

## Moh Jaiswal's Coursework and Projects at Ryerson University

Welcome to my combined portfolio for ECN627: Introduction to Econometrics and ECN702: Econometrics II, pivotal courses in my Economics and Management Science degree at Ryerson University. These courses deepened my understanding of econometric principles and honed my skills in applying advanced econometric techniques to analyze real-world economic data.

### Course Overviews

**ECN627** focused on the practical application of econometric techniques, including linear regression models, estimation, inference, and complexities such as heteroscedasticity, endogeneity, and binary dependent variable regressions.

**ECN702** built upon the foundation laid in ECN627, extending into more complex areas such as endogeneity problems and IV estimation, panel data models, binary choice models, and an introduction to time series analysis. This course was instrumental in advancing my econometric analysis capabilities, especially in handling panel data and time series.

### Key Topics and Personal Insights Across Both Courses:

- **Advanced Regression Analysis:** Mastered advanced topics in both linear and non-linear regression models, including IV and 2SLS, crucial for my analysis in financial econometrics.
- **Panel Data and Time Series:** Developed a solid understanding of panel data models and time series analysis, enabling me to handle data with both cross-sectional and temporal dimensions.
- **Binary Choice Models:** Gained insights into modeling binary outcomes through probit and logit models, enhancing my ability to analyze decisions in economics and finance.

## Personal Achievements and Projects

These courses allowed me to engage in complex projects, showcasing my ability to apply econometric concepts in diverse areas of economic and financial analysis.

### Major Projects:

- **Loan Applicant gender discrimination probability:** Employed Logit/Probit models to examine gender discrimnation in loan applicants within the US.
- **Panel Data Analysis of Employment Trends:** Employed panel data models to examine factors influencing employment rates across Canadian provinces over time.
- **Time Series Forecasting of Stock Market Returns:** Utilized time series models to forecast stock market returns, incorporating volatility modeling to improve prediction accuracy.

### Skills Developed:

- Advanced proficiency in R for econometric analysis, including IV estimation, panel data, and time series forecasting.
- Enhanced ability to design and conduct independent econometric research, culminating in a comprehensive understanding of econometric theory and application.
- Strengthened analytical and problem-solving skills, particularly in addressing complex econometric issues with sophisticated models.

## Course Materials and Tools

- **Textbook for ECN702:** Stock and Watson, Introduction to Econometrics, 4th Edition, Pearson. This textbook was invaluable for both courses, providing a solid theoretical foundation and practical examples.
- **Software:** Deepened my proficiency in R, crucial for assignments, labs, and the final exam in ECN702. This software competency was critical for my successful completion of lab exercises and econometric analysis projects.

## Assessment and Recognition

My performance in both courses was marked by high grades 3.67/4.33, reflecting my dedication to mastering econometric analysis. I would like to thank my professors Yu Wang and Laura Turner for their support and advice.
